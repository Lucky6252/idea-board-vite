IDEA BOARD
[Live Demo](https://idea-board-vite.vercel.app/)

# Idea Board remade with Vite

this is an idea boart that allows a user to create new ideas, edit existing ideas or delete them. Each idea is represented as a tile on the board that displays a title, description and character used as the user reaches the limit. The description text has max length of 140 characters.

There is a button to edit and or delete an existing tile. For buttons react-icon/md icons where used. It took me two days to create this version. 

# Requirement meet:

A page is responsive.
Each idea tile contains title and description and is editable.
localStorage API is used to persist current state when the page is refreshed.
Character count as the user is approaching the limit of their description.

# To Do

Ability to edit idea (title and description) inline.
Adding created/updated time.
Ability to sort ideas by date or alphabetically.
Add an unobtrusive notification when an update is made to a tile.

# Technologies used 

Typescript
CSS
React
